I am a Chief Researcher at  [Hitachi, Ltd](https://www.hitachi.com/rd/). My main research interests include physics-informed machine learning, but I am also interested in machine learning utilizing quantum computing and geographic information.

I am conducting my research on nonlinear dynamics as a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. [Hiroya Nakao](https://sites.google.com/sc.e.titech.ac.jp/hiroya-nakao/) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en).

Before that, I studied at the [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), where I received B.E. and M.E. degrees under the supervision of Prof. [Toshio Aoyagi](https://www-np.acs.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en).
